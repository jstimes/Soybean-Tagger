			<h3>About</h3>
			Soybean Tagger is an application used for marking images with several different disease options. It cycles through a directory
			of leaf images, allowing users to mark on them where they believe certain infected areas are.
			<!-- These marked images and the data regarding the options are downloaded.-->
			<br>
			<br> This site has been tested in Chrome & Firefox on both Windows and Mac. The libraries used do not support IE. If you experience
			issues on another platform, reach out to me at the email address below with some information about the problem.
			<br>
			<br> This was developed by Jacob Stimes. If you experience any issues, have questions, or would like to share feedback, please
			reach out to me at

			<h3>General Instructions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<!--li>Click the 'Upload Disease Options' to upload the list of diseases you wish to track. The file format expected is JSON. <a href='example-diseases.json' target=new>Click here</a> to see an example file format (note that there can not be a comma after the last entry). 'id' must contain no spaces. 'color' is optional. If not supplied, it will select colors from a default list.-->

				<li>
					<!--Your options should appear in the 'All options' list.-->Drag the diseases you identify into the 'Identified diseases' list. The currently selected disease has a red border
					around it.

					<li>Click and drag on the image where you believe the selected disease is located. Upon releasing the mouse, the path will
						be closed. Upon selecting a disease, an input box will appear on screen where a percentage can be entered to reflect
						disease severity.

						<li>Add more diseases if desired by dragging another option onto the identified diseases. Continue marking diseases you
							believe are in the image.
							<!--The diseases can be rearragned in the 'Identified diseases' list based on the severity (top disease reflects most severe, bottom is least severe).-->

							<li>Once you are done marking an image, click 'Save/Next Image'.
								<!--. A JSON file containing all the marking information will be downloaded, as well as an image of the marked leaf (if the image does not download, click the link that appears).-->

								<!--li>If you are satisfied with the output, click the 'Next Image' button that appears once 'Save' is clicked.
			
			<li>-->The marked image will be replaced with the next one, and all data is reset. Continue this procedure to keep marking
								images, your progress is shown in the upper right corner.

								<li>A message will be shown when you have marked all images.
			</ol>

			<h3>Options and Controls:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>'Show Selected Disease Only' - If checked, will only show markings on the image for the currently selected disease (all
					markings will still be drawn on the output image. If you'd like an image for each disease, send me an email to the above
					address and I could add that feature). Otherwise all markings are shown.

					<li>'Fill selection' - If checked, marked paths are filled in.

						<li>'Clear' - resets all markings and data for the current image

							<li>'Clear Selection' - resets only the markings and data for the currently selected disease (useful if you've already
								made several marks, but made one mistake).

								<li>'Undo' - removes the last drawn marking, and data associated with it
