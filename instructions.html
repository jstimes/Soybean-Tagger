		<h3>About</h3>
		Image Tagger is an application used for marking images with several different options. It cycles through a directory of leaf images, allowing users to mark on them where they believe certain infected areas are. These marked images and the data regarding the options are downloaded.<br><br>
		This site has been tested in Chrome & Firefox on both Windows and Mac. The libraries used do not support IE. If you experience issues on another platform, reach out to me at the email address below with some information about the problem.<br><br>
		This was developed by Jacob Stimes. If you experience any issues, have questions, or would like to share feedback, please reach out to me at <a href='mailto:jstimes@iastate.edu'>jstimes@iastate.edu</a>

		<h3>General Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Click the 'Upload Disease Options' to upload the list of diseases you wish to track. The file format expected is JSON. <a href='example-diseases.json' target=new>Click here</a> to see an example file format (note that there can not be a comma after the last entry). 'id' must contain no spaces. 'color' is optional. If not supplied, it will select colors from a default list.
			
			<li>Your options should appear in the 'All options' list. Drag the ones you want into the 'Identified diseases' list. The currently selected disease has a red border around it.
			
			<li>Click and drag on the image where you believe the selected disease it located,
			upon releasing the mouse, the path will be closed
			
			<li>Continue marking diseases you believe are in the image. The diseases can be rearragned in the 'Identified diseases' list based on the severity (top disease reflects most severe, bottom is least severe).
			
			<li>Once you are done marking an image, click 'Save'. A JSON file containing all the marking information will be downloaded, as well as an image of the marked leaf
			(if the image does not download, click the link that appears).
			
			<li>If you are satisfied with the output, click the 'Next Image' button that appears once 'Save' is clicked.
			
			<li>The marked image will be replaced with the next one, and all data is reset. Repeat steps 2-6 to keep marking images. 
			
			<li>A message will be shown when you have marked all images.
		</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div id='options'>
		<h3>Options and Controls:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>'Show Selected Disease Only' - If checked, will only show markings on the image for the currently selected disease (all markings will still be drawn on the output image. If you'd like an image for each disease, send me an email to the above address and I could add that feature). Otherwise all markings are shown.
			
			<li>'Fill selection' - If checked, marked paths are filled in.
			
			<li>'Clear' - resets all markings and data for the current image 
			
			<li>'Clear Selection' - resets only the markings and data for the currently selected disease (useful if you've already made several marks, but made one mistake).
			
			<li>'Undo' - removes the last drawn marking, and data associated with it 
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div id='output'>
		<h3>JSON output explanation:</h3>
		<p>
		The output file that is downloaded is pretty hard to read, I'd recommend you paste the text into this link, and then press 'Format' so that it's more neat.<br><br>
		For each disease that was marked on the image, there is an entry with that diseases id. Each of those diseases contains an array for each path that was drawn for that disease. Each path array contains a subarray for each point. The beginning point has an "M", then the X-coordinate, then the Y-coordinate. Each successive point has an "L", followed by the X-coordinate, then the Y-coordinate. The end of the path is marked with a "Z", and this will be the last subarray in the path array. Note that the last point is connected with the first point. The X-coordinate is measured from the left edge of the image, and is in pixels. The Y-coordinate is measured from the ?? edge of the image, also in pixels.
